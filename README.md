# GYTime

This is my first project which I made with php, html and css.
I started it abount 2 years ago and worked on it for 2 to 5 months.
I abandoned the project after I finished my work experience.

## The pupose of the project

It was supposed to count the amount of hours a employee has worked or how long his break was.<br>

### Features:

- [x] Simple Auth System
- [x] Work timer
- [x] Break timer
- [ ] Statistics

### Abondoned

I abandoned this project because the source files were lost (this repository is from a backup) and there is no point in working on it since there are so many issues with it.
